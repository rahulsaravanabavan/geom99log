This log is created to fullfil the accademic credits of the Course GEOM99 

**Week 14:**

• It was decided by our group members that I will work on the final website.

• We decided to use the same template as the A3Web which was used for the last semester. I will modify the collaborators in the GitHub page which was forked last semester as it was a group project.

• I forked the copy of that website and made the collaborators as my team mates.

• Uploaded every changed pages and committed the changes in the github.

• Since Helen our group mate thought that this website is complicated and drains more of our time, we made other website from the w3school.

Note: If your using others template from previous projects make sure everyone understands the code and complexity of those. 

Our a3web was simple and was reliable to read the code but due to our time constraints we could not use that.

Building a website from scratch makes sense and takes less time as you are creating them and can know about the Luke and corner of the website.

**Created a new page for the data source we collected:**

• This decision was made by our team to facilitate the user from where we got the data and how we processed those raw data.

This is a Technical Log representing the weekly work done during the week 9 in the course GEOM99 


Week 9 :
1.	Experience builder:
This is a solution which a non programmer loves to work with because of this solution, one can make web applications without even a single line of code types for this. This displays a wide variety of data within it also represents 2D and 3D data within it. This technology works by drag and drop a unique theme to work on and then host it in your platform of your choice.
Design your own blueprint from the layouts provided.
Customize the page with build up web pages and also interact with the users with those functionalities.
The main advantage of this technology is that it can easily adapt with the screen width automatically for the mobile and tab users, it is praised for it portability with the modern devices. Moreover, we can edit those UI UX for the different screen widths.
It is available locally for the developers edition.
This uses a different web page not a incorporated technology within ArcGIS environment. (I think ESRI will come up with different technologies using this to find unique solutions, as the world is moving towards the Web era.)
Workflow:
 -	Choose a template.
 -	Add data
 -	Customize your theme.
 -	Optimize the screen width for smaller screen size.
 -	Share.

2.	ArcGIS Dashboards:
These are user interactive Web pages which displays map application which is more oriented towards data visualization for the user and to play along with that. These are mainly presented in the statistic forms as they are visually appealing to the users and they can convey more information rather than raw data presented for the users.
The useful thing of this dashboard is for comparison of different types of data and if you have many data to represent and not to bore the user we can use this as a tool to represent lots of data in a meaningful and appealing way to the users.
  - The data visualization includes:
     - Maps
     - Legends
     - Charts (Pie, bar )
     - Indicator 
     -  Gauge 
     -  Indicators etc.
It also uses the real time data representation for the collaboration purpose and live GPS data can be displayed.
We can incorporate popup features this could also be a useful web application to track real time data such as traffic, accidents GPS used data for many purpose.
Additionally this is also like experience builder which can translate between mobile devices with smaller screen size.
Information window, splash window, embedded Html option for text editing are the new features after the Latest update.
Finally dashboards are components of AGOL so can be referenced and sited with the item id after publishing.

3.	Story Maps:
These are the most intuitive component of AGOL which delivers a story as a Map component with blended version, so smooth and easily operated. This is like a narrative text.
This is based mainly on the map in the right hand side and while we create a complete story it acts as a Slide show presentation with smoother map experience .
You can distribute and circulate your stories and briefings by sharing their unique URLs. These URLs allow you to disseminate your content within your organization, to particular groups, or to the general public.
This is more like a journey or a process undergone to get a ultimate product the each stage of process can be got to the slides for a blended experience for the users.
This stores the items as a JSON item and shows the user for better and improved experience of a map.

5. Focused Configurable Apps:
This is a open source ESRI GitHub page which has lots of applications which we can get used of this to create a client end web application within some short span of time.
This is created by JS API team from ESRI for easy configurable apps within short time, also we can edit those source codes for our end purpose if we need to be more specific about the application we build.

6. ArcGIS Hub:
This application is also similar to drag and drop web application which we explored in the previous items. 
The items here are created by rows of blocks which acts as a <DIV> element in html, where this can be customized further which looks like a web application build without no code. This can also be known as no code solution for a web map based application.
The best practise is to add a row before you add any content to a draft.
This can also hold data which stores that as a hub, that is referenced from the other web application.
We can choose themes and change the colours also which we can do in experience builder also, though this is an AGOL item.
The disadvantage of this item is there is no undo button if it is done then it will be done, so the best practise is to save a draft and work on it so if your not satisfied with that we can later delete that and create a new one.
The other feature of this hub is we can add cards that is a feature like text, image, gallery(which is a ArcGIS content).
Iframe uses the hub to incorporate external websites that can be shown in our hub.

7. ArcGIS Field Maps:
This application is more like a field application for data collection. It is more mobile friendly and collects data in a efficient way that is GPS data can be collected from the mobile devices.
This is a Mobile app which can also be installed in windows by WAS windows amazon service.
Design the application for mobile devices and all set for the data collection.
There is also a feature for map viewer in mobile applications so that the data we collected could be gone through in the mobile to verify its actionability.

Project Building a User friendly Transit Web application for People of Lindsay.
1.	I have planned this to do with ESRI JS API since I have worked with that before, but the only problem I faced during those time ( my early Project was the API was not working from the ESRI side )
2.	First, I didn’t paste the API key then it produced this error.

Same bug isn’t resolved yet, so I have to try any other method this method failed.

3.	I tried with a API key which was created for last project.

4.	The next step would be commenting out the API key since it worked for my class mates in the last project.

The same result was displayed (No show).

 After creating a new API key the map displayed, so going to try out the routes from that.

Esri Leaflet:

This is my second method trying to display a map, since this is a open source from Esri it will produce a map.
 





 

The same error popped out and it did not produce a map.
